<h1>Tank Game</h1>

Here is a tank game (simply named Tank Game) made with Python using the pygame library. 
<br>This project was made in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/Cefucr">@Cefucr</a>.
<br>In the files I didnt include the pictures of the tanks, bullet etc.

For the tank game, we made custom controllers that had:
<ul>
  <li>Two slide potentiometers</li>
  <li>one normal potentiometer</li>
  <li>two buttons</li>
</ul>
<br>
From the two sliding potentiometers the tanks movement would be controlled. With the normal potentiometer we would move the tanks barrel. 
The buttons would be used to shoot a bullet and the other to plant a mine.

Here is a picture of what the controllers looked like in the beta version.<br><br>

After making the tank game we made actual controllers so that we could play the game properly here is what the controllers looked like after they were done.<br><br>

 We still had the problem of not fitting the arduino into which everything was connected into the two controllers so we made a third box that acted like the "brains" of the controllers. Here is what the whole system looked like when it was done.<br><br>

 The whole thing was connected to a laptop to run the code but we put a raspberry pi 4 into the "brains" so that we could run the thing on its own without another computer we would only need a monitor. In the end we decided not to show that simply because we could not find speakers to play the sounds of the game.
